WebGL Music Visualizer
============

> This music visualizer allows you to create and watch real-time visualizations of music.  Load one of the presets to watch an Android dance or a solar system bounce to the beat.  Add shapes and lighting effects to the scene that vary according to time and frequencies in the music â€“ all in real time in a web browser!  This demo includes customizable 3D geometry, audio analysis, particle and lighting effects.

Made for Google for the launch of the WebGL in Chrome
